# What my project does and why it's useful
This example focuses on manipulating color through hue, saturation, and brightness.

This prototype allows you to change these variables through a rotating dial.

It is useful because it allows the user to have a condensed experience when manipulating these variables, all of it it in one handy dial/button that makes it faster to manipulate the color.

## How to use
To use this is quite simple, you spin the dial to adjust the value for each factor (hue, saturation, light), and when you want to cycle between the factors you press the button, allowing you to mold a color based on hue, saturation, and light.


## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of the ZingTouch library:

https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."

## Who is responsible
This example was created by Jaeger Ehrenbeck
