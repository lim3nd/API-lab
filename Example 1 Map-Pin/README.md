# Map pin example
This prototype showcases the pan gesture of the ZingTouch library. In this example the pan gesture is used to move a pin over a map.

## How to use
Simply drag the pin around the map using the cursor. The pan gesture is tracking the cursor's position whenever the pin is pressed, positioning the pin where the user chooses.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch: https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."
