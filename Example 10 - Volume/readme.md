# Volume Bar using Pan
This prototype explores the pan feature of the ZingTouch library by showing a draggable bar that changes the value of volume depending on it's position.

## How to use
The volume bar can be dragged towards both left and right, and the number display below the bar will change by 10 units depending on the position of the draggable piece.
Most of the code is located in the main.js file and the .css file. Minor visual changes are located in the .html file.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of the ZingTouch library:

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."

## Who is responsible
The prototype was coded by Agust√≠n Guerrero.
