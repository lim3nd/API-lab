# Brightness with swipe
This prototype explores the swiping feature of Zingtouch in order to change the brightness of the screen.

## How to use
All code is in main.js. applyBrightness(x, bgColor, frontColor) handles the functionality of the brightness of the swipe, and
it sets desired background as well as color on top of that.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch:
https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle.""
