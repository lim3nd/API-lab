# Brightness with swipe
This prototype explores the swiping feature of Zingtouch in order to show direction on a map.

## How to use
All code is in main.js. A custom drawImage-fuction handles the arrow placement as well as its rotation:
drawImage(ctx, image, x, y, w, h, degrees)

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch:
https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle.""

## Who is responsible
Christian Golcic made this prototype. It is slightly based on the Bubble example (ZingTouch's), but heavily modified. The part from the example that is still present is the code used for the swipe. The rest of the functionality is made by Christian.
