# Color Wheel with Rotation
This prototype explores the rotation feature of the ZingTouch library by showing a rotatable wheel that changes color depending on it's position.

## How to use
The color wheel can be rotated both clockwise and counter-clockwise, and the color landing in the arrow on top of the wheel will be displayed in the middle circle.
Most of the code is located in the main.js file. Minor visual changes are located in the .css file and .html file.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of the ZingTouch library:

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."

## Who is responsible
The prototype was coded by Agust√≠n Guerrero.
