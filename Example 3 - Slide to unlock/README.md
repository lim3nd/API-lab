# Slide to unlock example
This prototype showcases the pan gesture of the ZingTouch library. In this example the pan gesture is used to move the slider in a recreation of the "Slide to unlock" slider from the first iOS version.

## How to use
Using the cursor or touch, the slider responds to the user input. The pan gesture is triggered when the slider is interacted with, changing the position of the slider in sync with the users motion. When slider reaches max, the example reloads.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch: https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."
