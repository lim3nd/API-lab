# Drag and Drop examples
This prototype explores the Swipe-motion of the ZingTouch library. The context of which the motion is used is for navigating trough a text document by swiping left or right to go to next or previous page.

## How to use
The swipe motion tracks where the motion is started and where the motion is ended, and gives the angle from the start. By using the angle it is easy to determine which direction the user have swiped.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch: https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."
