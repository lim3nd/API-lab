This example is a prototype egg timer.

The egg timer assists in timing the cooking of the user's eggs.

This example has use in allowing easier access to an egg timer, you no longer have to own an analogue egg timer and fidget with it; this egg timer allows you to set it in mere seconds and is more accessible as it does not need to be located in a kitchen, and set up physically, etc.

To use this egg timer you spin the dial in either direction to set the desired time, the maximum time is 60 seconds so you can think of this egg timer as a pie chart essentially, allowing a more tangible sense of how long you're setting it for without the use of explicitly labelled numbers. You then click the button in the left hand corner to initiate and it begins a countdown for your set number. *Note*: The dial does not move, it only sets the time.
