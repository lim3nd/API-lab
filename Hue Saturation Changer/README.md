This example focuses on manipulating color through hue, saturation, and brightness.

This example allows you to change these variables through a rotating dial.

This example is useful because it allows the user to have a condensed experience when manipulating these variables, all of it it in one handy dial/button that makes it faster to manipulate the color.

To use this is quite simple, you spin the dial to adjust the value for each factor (hue, saturation, light), and when you want to cycle between the factors you press the button.
