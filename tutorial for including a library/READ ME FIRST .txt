FIRST:
Download GitHub Desktop for either Windows or Mac.

Then install it and log in to your GitHub account, in order to be able to see the projects 
your account has access to (in this case API-lab).

NOTE: Before you do anything - IF you already downloaded the repository, I strongly suggest you
pull the changes. You do this in GitHub desktop by clicking Repository and then Pull.

Now follow the image-instructions unless you already cloned the repository from before.
