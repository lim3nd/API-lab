# Drag and Drop examples
This prototype explores the Pan-motion of the ZingTouch library. The context the motion is used for is a Drag and Drop function which could be used to "save" html elements. This could for example be a comment on a forum page.

## How to use
The pan-event gives the change.x and change.y parameters which makes it easy to move a html elements by combining it with changing the css through JavaScript using htmlElement.style.left & htmlELement.style.top.

## Maintenance and contribution to the project
This prototype was made with the help of Zingtouch: https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

"A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's life cycle."
